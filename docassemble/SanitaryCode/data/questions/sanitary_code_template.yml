field: sanitary_code_template_intro
question: |
  Tenant Petition for the Enforcement of the State Sanitary Code
subquestion: |
  Tenants use this petition to ask a judge to:
  
  * order the landlord to make repairs. It is especially useful when you have emergency repairs that need to be fixed quickly.
  * lower your rent to the {fair rental value} of your apartment,  
  * order you to pay the {fair rental value} **to the court** while the landlord makes the repairs, or
  * appoint a {receiver}, or temporary landlord.</br>
  If you are going to ask the judge for a temporary landlord, try to [get help from a lawyer](https://MassLegalHelp.org/find-legal-aid).
  
  The law that allows this petition is [M.G.L c. 111 
  ยง127C-I](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVI/Chapter111/Section127C).
terms:
 - receiver: |
    A receiver is a person or organization the court appoints to manage a property temporarily because the landlord is irresponsible or impossible to reach. </br></br>
    
    The receiver  enforces the state Sanitary Code. </br></br>
    
    Tenants can use receivership as way to get necessary repairs made and prevent their building from deteriorating.</br></br>
    
    See [Receiverships](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-8-receivership).
 - fair rental value: |
     The fair rental value is the value of the apartment with all of its problems.
